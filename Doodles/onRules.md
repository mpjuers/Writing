# On Rules

## Neko Whetever-the-Fuck

I have mostly thought of myself as a
(historically, and for the sake of the idiom)
"rules guy". 
I get rules. They make sense.
They allow us to do things without some agonizing background moral calculus
all the damn time.
I was vegan for a while. That was a rule.
I stopped when I realized that it wasn't effective as a heuristic for accomplishing any human goal
other than feeling like I behaved morally.
It was a bad rule.
I think traffic lights are a good idea. They are, in effect, rules.
That is a different question than, "Who owns the traffic lights?"
However, we need to make sure that the following of rules is in the end in the service of the human experience.
